# NBA MVP Scoring GitHub Contributions

Welcome to the NBA MVP Scoring GitHub Contributions project! This project aims to visualise the scoring contributions of NBA players in a GitHub-like contribution graph format.

## Overview

The graph is interactive, allowing users to click on individual boxes to view detailed information about each game.
